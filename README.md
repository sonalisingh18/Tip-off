    Tip-off: Teaching's Instant Progress (Tip-off meaning - passing secrete message)
    As a student sometimes we all have been in a classroom where the teacher's lecture was 
    flying over our head, we thought that teacher should either reduce or increase his pace, 
    felt a need for an example to explain the tricky concept but we felt hesitant in speaking 
    in front of the class & the teacher and wished that there should have been a way to express 
    my feedback for the lecture without confrontation.
    And if you are a teacher then you might have thought of getting honest reviews from your 
    students about your teaching style, so that you can improve it.

    So, this is what Tip-off does. Using Tip-off you can provide feedback to the lectures in 
    real-time anonymously without interrupting the class flow and based on the feedback from 
    students, teachers can change improve their style of teaching or answer any query that 
    has been put up by the students.

### :dart: Final prototye of project: 
    The final prototype of the project can perform the following actions.
    1. As a teacher create a new room, then a Classroom ID will be generated and the teacher can share the Classroom ID with the students.
    2. As a student join a room by entering Classroom ID.
    3. Students can provide feedback on parameters like Concept Clarity, Speed, Engagement.
    4. Students can send any query to the teacher.
    5. Teachers can see the feedback gauge and the graph value changes in real-time as there is any change in the feedback parameters.
    6. Teachers will receive a notification when any students send a message.
    7. Graph will display individual fluctuations in feedback values for all the students with a thin line and the thick line represents the average feedback value of all the students.
